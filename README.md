During the course of this project:
* Designed and automated 4+ test cases following Page Object Model design pattern using Page Factory, Selenium and TestNG.
* Utilized Apache POI in each test to accept dynamic test data.
* Created a TestNG project for easily running automated test cases.
* Implemented Singleton pattern for initializing WedDriver to make effective use of resources.
* Generated customized test reports for the TestNG project using Extent Reports.
